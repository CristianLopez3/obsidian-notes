**Control inbound and outbound traffic at the resource level**

After a packet has entered a subnet, it must have its permissions evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as Amazon EC2 instances. A security group is the VPC component that checks packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance. It is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for specific AWS resources, like Amazon EC2 instances.

By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. For this example, suppose that you are at an apartment building with a door attendant who greets guests at the door. You can think of the guests as packets and the door attendant as a security group. With the default settings, the security groups won't let anyone in and allows all outbound traffic out.

With security groups, you can add custom rules to configure which traffic should be allowed. Any other traffic would then be denied. For example, custom rules can be given separately for inbound and outbound traffic. As guests arrive, the door attendant checks a list to makes sure they can enter the building. However, the door attendant does not check the list again when guests are exiting the building.


**Note:** If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within the same VPC, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance.

**Stateful packet filtering**

Security groups perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

Consider the same example of sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance to the internet. When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.
