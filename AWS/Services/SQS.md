Amazon SQS is a message queuing service that facilitates reliable communication between software components. It can send, store, and receive messages at any scale, making sure messages are not lost and that other services don't need to be available for processing. In Amazon SQS, an application places messages into a queue, and a user or service retrieves the message, processes it, and then removes it from the queue.

### Example: Amazon SQS

As customer support teams grow and the volume of issues increases, traditional workflows can struggle to keep up. Let's consider how a customer supportÂ team might tackle this challenge.

**Scenario**
A customer support team consists of a support agent and a technical specialist. The support agent is responsible for receiving customer issues, and the technical specialist works on resolving them. This process works well as long as both the agent and specialist are available and coordinated.

**Challenge**
However, what happens if the support agent creates a ticket but the technical specialist is busy working on another issue or unavailable? The agent would have to wait until the specialist is free to accept the new ticket, causing delays in resolving customer issues and extending wait times for customers. As the volume of customer issues increases, this process becomes inefficient.

**Solution**
To improve efficiency, they implement a queue system using Amazon SQS. The support agent adds customer issues to the queue, creating a backlog. Even if the specialist is busy, the agent can continue adding new issues. The specialist checks the queue, resolves issues, and updates the agent. This system provides a smooth workflow and helps handle higher volumes without delays or bottlenecks.
