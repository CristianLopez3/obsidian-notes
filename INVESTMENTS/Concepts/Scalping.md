Scalping is a trading strategy (not long-term investment) that consists in make vert fast frequent trades to take advantage of small movements in the price of an asset.

The scalper's goal is to earn a few cents or points per trade, but to do it  many times a day so that those small gains add up to a significant profit.

### Fictitious example:

Suppose John, a scalper, is watching **Apple (AAPL)** stock.

- At 10:01 a.m., he sees that the price is at **$180.00** and buys 100 shares.
    
- At 10:03 a.m., the price rises to **$180.15**, and John sells his shares.
    

➡️ **Gross profit:** 100 shares × $0.15 = **$15 USD** 
If John repeats this process 10 times a day successfully, he can earn **$150 per day**, without waiting for the market to go up or down in the long run.
